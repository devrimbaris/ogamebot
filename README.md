This was a bot I have written way ago(around 2005) when I used to play ogame and got bored of waiting while upgrading the planets.

Quickly it became one of my most enjoyable projects to develop.

It does NOT work for the current games.

But can give you a rough idea.

I lost the code for which I have developed for expressing conditionals in XML to get rid of code updates when I want to change some rules.


Anyway it was fun back then!
